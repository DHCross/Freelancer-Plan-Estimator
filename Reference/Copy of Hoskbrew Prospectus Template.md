# **Resource Management**

## Enhancing Project Predictability & Resource Management

### Executive Summary

This document presents key observations from recent project execution and proposes a role-based framework to significantly improve predictability, efficiency, and resource management. By implementing targeted time allocation and mandatory tracking, we move from estimation to precise, data-driven management, thereby optimizing resource utilization and enhancing forecasting accuracy. Please note that **due to data limitations, a specific, numerical total forecasted time for a large project cannot be provided at this stage.** The focus of this document is on the allocation of time by role.

### 1\. Critical Insights from Project Analysis

Recent project analysis (notably Project A1) underscores key factors influencing timelines and resource allocation:

* **Significant Scope Dynamics**: Projects may significantly expand due to creative and mechanical necessities (e.g., Project A1 expanded from \~17k words to \>158k words). This growth, while justified, demands robust management to avoid uncontrolled scope creep.  
* **Incomplete Effort Data**: Reliance solely on individual time tracking limited accurate project cost and duration assessments. Comprehensive team-wide tracking remains essential for reliable forecasting.  
* **Process-Building Overhead**: Concurrent development of essential workflows (version control, editing sequences, layout protocols) initially added significant overhead, but this foundational infrastructure is now expected to enhance future efficiency.

### 2\. Project Scope & Role-Based Effort Allocation

Predictability improves significantly with clear scope benchmarks and structured effort distribution:

**Scope Benchmarks**:

* Micro Module: 6k–12k words  
* Small Adventure: 15k–25k words  
* Large Adventure: 50k–90k words  
* Core Rulebook: 120k–200k+ words

**Typical Role & Effort Distribution**:

* **Writing (40–50%)**: Lead drafting, secondary contributions, feedback integration.  
* **Editing (10–14%)**: Developmental editing (structure/narrative), copyediting (clarity/accuracy).  
* **Layout & Visuals (10–15%)**: Design, formatting, and final layout preparation.  
* **Project Management & Coordination (10–15%)**: Scheduling, tracking, and risk mitigation.  
* **Art/Map Coordination (3–5%)**: Asset management and vendor communications.  
* **QA/Proofreading (2–3%)**: Final quality checks.  
* **Administrative & Technical Support (10–13%)**: This includes meetings, administration, technical support, and synchronization activities.

### 3\. Structured Framework for Role-Based Management

Moving forward, predictable outcomes require clearly defined roles, allocated hours, and disciplined tracking:

**Framework Components**:

* **Defined Roles**: Explicitly assign roles per project.  
* **Hourly Allocation**: Allocate specific weekly hours per team member, project, and role.  
* **Mandatory Time Tracking**: Enforce logging of hours in dedicated tools (e.g., Clockify).  
* **Weekly Reviews**: Review planned vs. actual hours regularly, identify discrepancies, and make proactive adjustments.

**Benefits of the Framework**:

* Enhanced accuracy in forecasting  
* Improved resource allocation and utilization  
* Tightened budget control  
* Clearer visibility into project status  
* Greater operational scalability

### 4\. Implementation Guidelines

To effectively operationalize this framework:

* Log time strictly against assigned roles and projects.  
* Clearly define weekly availability for each team member.  
* Monitor progress and budgets regularly, adjusting allocations to maintain accuracy.  
* Use real-time data to refine project estimates continuously.

### 5\. Next Steps

Immediate actions to move from theory to practice:

* Assign team members specific roles and projects.  
* Confirm individual weekly hours availability.  
* Set up standardized time-tracking systems and procedures.  
* Regularly review and adjust allocations based on collected data.

### Conclusion & Recommendation

The foundational infrastructure for project production is now established. Implementing a structured role-based time allocation and tracking system is essential to fully leveraging this investment. This structured approach enables informed management decisions, tighter budget control, and enhanced project predictability.

**Recommendation**: Initiate immediate discussions to integrate this structured management framework into all current and future project workflows.

**Note on Analysis Basis** The above insights and recommendations derive from a detailed retrospective analysis, including meticulous personal logging (over 384 hours across writing, editing, layout, and coordination). Although primarily based on individual data, these insights offer a robust starting point for broader team adoption and ongoing refinement with comprehensive team data integration.

# **Hours Allocation**

Here's a visual table designed for *at-a-glance planning*—a flexible, rules-of-thumb style breakdown you can adapt to different project sizes. This includes roles, suggested percent ranges based on your prior Hoskbrew data, and notes for interpreting solo vs. team roles.

### 📊 **Scalable Role & Time Allocation Reference Table (Rules of Thumb)**

| Role / Activity | Solo Contributor (%) | Team-Based (%) | Example Tasks | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Writing / Development** | 35–45% | 25–35% | Drafting narrative, rules, stat blocks | Central creative output; often split across writers in team settings |
| **Editing (Dev \+ Copy)** | 10–15% | 12–18% | Structural edits, proofreading, feedback | Split into developmental and copy if team is large |
| **Layout / Design** | 15–25% | 10–20% | Affinity work, formatting, visual passes | Higher if print-ready formatting is expected |
| **Planning / Coordination** | 5–10% | 10–15% | Scheduling, outlining, roadmap creation | More centralized in solo projects, but expands with team size |
| **Meetings / Sync Time** | 5% | 10–12% | Weekly standups, team review sessions | Can vary by team culture and leadership structure |
| **Art / Visual Assets** | 5–10% | 5–15% | Illustration briefs, commissions, maps | Often external or parallel track |
| **QA / Final Review** | 2–5% | 5–8% | Spellchecking, formatting validation | Add more for mechanically dense or published projects |
| **Support / Admin** | 2–3% | 3–5% | File management, backup, version control | Easily overlooked—track time here if juggling tools or uploads |

###  How to Use

* Multiply total project hours by these percentages for rough time planning.  
* Solo column \= when one person does most of the roles (e.g., you on A1).  
* Team column \= when roles are distributed across contributors.  
* Use midpoints for quick math; adjust edges for lean/heavy scenarios.

**Breaking down the tables**

**Hoskbrew Project Planning \- Key Points**

* **I’m using tables to determine time and roles. There are two main tables: one for the hours needed for each role and another for the percentage breakdown.**  
* **Table 1: Hour Allocation Model. This one shows how many hours each role (writer, editor, etc.) will need for a big project (75,000 words). It even includes extra "just in case" hours (contingency).**  
* **Table 2: Role & Activity % Breakdown. This one shows the percentage of time each role spends on different things. It helps us see where most of our time is going.**  
* **Example Summary. A quick breakdown of the broad categories of work and their overall percentages.**  
* **Next Steps. We need to assign people to roles, check when everyone's free, ensure everyone tracks their time the same way, and then use past projects to improve our estimates.**  
* **A1 Project Review. The A1 project got WAY bigger than expected (17k words turned into 158k\!). Dan logged a ton of hours, doing everything from writing to planning. But we only have my hours, not everyone else's.**  
* **Project Size Categories. We have projects of different sizes, from tiny "Micro Modules" to massive "Core Rulebooks" with varying word counts.**  
* **Prospectus Model Recommendation: We should plan projects by determining the number of hours each role needs and adding extra time for unexpected events.**  
* **Implementation Guidelines. People should only log time for the role they're assigned. We need to know how much time people have, track different kinds of work separately, and focus on role hours, not just individual hours.**  
* **Operational Recommendations. We need to track hours by role, everyone needs to log time the same way, we need to try to keep the project from getting bigger, we need to figure out how people get paid, we need to update our plans as we go, and leadership needs to keep track of resources.**  
* **Q2 2025 Projects. We have several projects in different stages: some are done, some are being written, some are planned, and some are on hold.**
