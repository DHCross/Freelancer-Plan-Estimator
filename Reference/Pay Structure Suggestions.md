## **Freelancer Compensation Guide**

### **Introduction**

This guide provides comprehensive recommendations for setting compensation rates for freelancers and contractors involved in our game projects. The proposed rates are based on industry averages, anchored to a baseline combined hourly rate of $20 (covering both technical and creative work). This benchmark reflects the current compensation structure within our startup environment, recognizing that it is a temporary measure until adjustments can be made to better align with industry standards.

### **1\. Practical Recommendations for Offering Rates**

#### **1.1. Grounded in a Combined Role ($20/hour) with a Temporary Benchmark**

* **Current Benchmark:** My (Dan Cross) hourly rate of $20 encompasses both technical and creative responsibilities. While this rate is below industry standards, it serves as a temporary benchmark due to startup financial constraints.  
* **Future Adjustments:** Plans are in place to reassess and adjust compensation as the company grows and secures additional funding, ensuring fair and competitive rates for all roles.

#### **1.2. Per-Word and Hourly Rates by Task Complexity**

| Task | Per Word Range | Hourly Benchmark | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Technical Writing** | $0.030 – $0.040 | $15 – $20/hour | Specialized tasks like stat blocks or mechanics requires technical expertise. |
| **Creative Development** | $0.030 – $0.040 | $15 – $20/hour | Creative tasks requiring innovation and narrative development. |
| **Development Editing** | $0.025 – $0.035 | $12 – $17/hour | Refining ideas and content; ensures quality without generating new content. |
| **Copyediting** | $0.020 – $0.030 | $10 – $15/hour | Focuses on grammar, syntax, and clarity with efficient throughput. |
| **Proofreading** | $0.018 – $0.025 | $9 – $12/hour | Final typo checks; ensures accuracy with minimal cognitive load. |
| **Rules Checking** | $0.025 – $0.035 | $12 – $17/hour | Ensures system balance and accuracy; requires attention to detail. |

**Note:** All per-word rates are set to a minimum of $0.03 to ensure professional compensation, recognizing that these rates are based on the current $20/hour benchmark for combined roles.

### **2\. Factors to Consider**

#### **2.1. Temporary Compensation Benchmark**

* **Startup Constraints:** Current rates reflect the financial limitations of a startup environment. These rates are temporary and will be reassessed as the company scales.  
* **Acknowledging Undercompensation:** Recognize that the $20/hour rate is below industry standards for combined technical and creative roles. This acknowledgment sets the stage for future negotiations and adjustments.

#### **2.2. Flexibility in Rate Models**

* **Per-Word vs. Hourly:** Utilize per-word rates for deliverables (e.g., stat blocks, narrative content) and hourly rates for tasks like editing, proofreading, or rules-checking to align compensation with task nature.

#### **2.3. Scaling Rates by Experience**

* **Entry-Level Professionals:** Offer rates at the lower end of the spectrum (e.g., $0.030/word for technical writing).  
* **Experienced Professionals:** Offer rates at the higher end of the spectrum (e.g., $0.040/word for creative development).

#### **2.4. Transparency About Growth**

* **Rate Increases:** Present initial rates as a baseline with opportunities for increases based on project success, quality of work, or expanded responsibilities.  
* **Future Adjustments:** Communicate plans to adjust rates as the company grows, ensuring freelancers understand the temporary nature of current compensation.

### **3\. Sample Communication for Martin**

"For freelance hires, we’ll start with rates that reflect their specialization and the complexity of the task, ensuring all roles meet a professional compensation standard. For example, technical writing tasks like stat blocks might be $0.030–$0.040 per word, while creative development could also be $0.030–$0.040 per word. Hourly rates are more suitable for tasks such as proofreading ($9–$12/hour) or rules checking ($12–$17/hour). These rates are based on our current budget constraints and the combined technical and creative responsibilities within our team. As we grow, we plan to reassess and increase these rates to better align with industry standards and ensure fair compensation for all contributors."

### **4\. Methodology for Deriving Rates**

#### **4.1. Setting the Combined Hourly Benchmark with Temporary Rates**

* **Benchmark Rate:** $20/hour covers both technical and creative work. This rate is used as a starting point for setting freelancer rates, acknowledging that it is below industry standards.

#### **4.2. Writing Speed Assumptions**

* **Deliberate Pace:** 500 words/hour for complex or detailed tasks (e.g., technical writing, rules checking).  
* **Efficient Pace:** 1,000 words/hour for simpler or less intensive work (e.g., proofreading, copyediting).

#### **4.3. Calculating Per-Word Rates**

* **Formula:** (Hourly Rate per Domain) ÷ Writing Speed \= Equivalent Per-Word Rate

  * **Technical Writing:** $15/hour ÷ 500 words/hour \= $0.030/word  
  * **Technical Writing:** $20/hour ÷ 1,000 words/hour \= $0.020/word (adjusted to meet minimum $0.03)  
  * **Creative Development:** $15/hour ÷ 500 words/hour \= $0.030/word  
  * **Creative Development:** $20/hour ÷ 1,000 words/hour \= $0.020/word (adjusted to meet minimum $0.03)  
* **Adjusted Rates:**

  * **Technical Writing:** $0.030 – $0.040/word  
  * **Creative Development:** $0.030 – $0.040/word

#### **4.4. Task Complexity Adjustments**

* **Technical Writing:** Specialized tasks like stat blocks are set at $0.030 – $0.040 per word.  
* **Creative Development:** Narrative and creative tasks are similarly priced at $0.030 – $0.040 per word.  
* **Development Editing:** Refining content is priced at $0.025 – $0.035 per word.  
* **Copyediting & Proofreading:** Efficient, less intensive tasks are priced at $0.020 – $0.030 and $0.018 – $0.025 per word, respectively.  
* **Rules Checking:** Technical and detail-oriented, priced at $0.025 – $0.035 per word.

#### **4.5. Flexibility for Variable Speeds**

* **Dual Scenarios:**

  * **Deliberate Work (500 wph):** Higher per-word rate for quality-focused tasks.  
  * **Efficient Work (1,000 wph):** Lower per-word rate, adjusted to meet the minimum threshold.  
* **Examples:**

  * **Technical Writing:**  
    * 500 wph: $0.030/word  
    * 1,000 wph: $0.030/word (minimum maintained)  
  * **Creative Development:**  
    * 500 wph: $0.030/word  
    * 1,000 wph: $0.030/word (minimum maintained)

#### **4.6. Validating Against Industry Realities**

* **Industry Comparison:**

  * **Minimum:** $0.05/word for entry-level to professional tasks like proofreading.  
  * **Mid-Tier:** $0.06–$0.12/word for creative development, technical writing, and editing.  
  * **Top-Tier:** $0.15–$0.20/word for veteran professionals or complex work.  
* **Adjustment:** Our rates are currently below industry standards due to startup constraints. However, setting a professional minimum of $0.03/word ensures that we remain competitive and fair within our current financial framework, with plans to increase rates as resources allow.

#### **4.7. Cross-Referencing with Yearly Income Data**

* **Assumptions:**

  * 200 workdays/year  
  * 1,000 words/day  
* **Annual Income Examples:**

  * **$0.030/word \= $6,000/year**  
  * **$0.040/word \= $8,000/year**  
  * **$0.025/word \= $5,000/year**  
  * **$0.020/word \= $4,000/year** (Adjusted to meet $0.03 minimum)  
* **Purpose:** Ensures that our rates are sustainable and fair within the startup’s financial framework while recognizing the need for future adjustments to align with professional standards.

### **5\. Outcome**

The proposed compensation structure effectively balances task complexity, productivity expectations, and fairness within our current startup budget constraints. By setting a professional minimum compensation threshold and differentiating rates based on task specialization and complexity, we aim to attract qualified freelancers and contractors who can contribute high-quality work to our game projects. This framework acknowledges the temporary nature of current rates and establishes a foundation for future adjustments as the company grows.

### **6\. Conclusion**

Implementing this revised rate structure will enable Martin to offer competitive and fair compensation to professionals, ensuring valuable contributions to our game projects while maintaining financial sustainability for our startup. Transparency about the current compensation limitations and a clear plan for future rate adjustments will help maintain trust and motivation among freelancers and contractors.

## Personal Note

Here’s how I see it when I crunch the numbers based on my own productivity:

On average, I write **2.2 words per minute**, which works out to **132 words an hour** and about **611 words a day**, with my best days hitting around **943 words**. When I compare that to common per-word rates like **$0.06/word**, it’s clear that freelancing strictly for word count just doesn’t add up for me.

### **Hourly Earnings at $0.06/Word**

At **132 words an hour**, I’d only make **$7.92/hour**. Even if I managed 200 words an hour, which feels like pushing it on a complex project, I’d still only hit **$12/hour**. It’s only at something like 500 words an hour—far beyond what’s realistic for me on big projects—that the pay becomes decent at **$30/hour**.

### **Daily Earnings at $0.06/Word**

When I look at my average daily output of **611 words**, that’s only **$36.66/day**. Even on a great day, like when I hit **943 words**, I’d earn **$56.58/day**. That’s still well below what most professionals aim for, which is closer to **$90–$120/day** at **1500–2000 words/day**.

### **Why Hourly Pay Works Better for Me**

At my current **$20/hour**, I’m not stuck chasing unrealistic word counts to make a livable income. I know my productivity varies because I’m doing more than just writing—I’m brainstorming, editing, testing mechanics, and refining ideas. Hourly pay reflects the value of all that work, not just the words I produce. If I were paid strictly per word, especially at rates like $0.06, it wouldn’t come close to being fair for the time and effort I put in.

### **Final Thoughts**

Looking at these numbers, it’s clear why hourly pay works so much better for me. Per-word rates can be brutal, especially on projects that require a lot of thought and creativity. With hourly compensation, I’m not penalized for taking the time to get things right, and it feels sustainable in a way that straight freelancing just doesn’t. It also makes me think about how Martin should approach rates for other contributors—this kind of clarity could really help set realistic expectations for everyone involved.
