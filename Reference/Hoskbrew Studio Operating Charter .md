## 1\. Mission and Vision Alignment

Hoskbrew’s mission is to create modular, narrative-rich tabletop RPG products that intricately balance player agency with immersive storytelling and coherent worldbuilding. Central to this mission is the multiverse of Ainerêve—a reality where the physics of the waking world yield to the power of belief. Shaped by dreams and imagination, Ainerêve is built upon foundational principles that allow entire self-contained universes, or “bubble realities,” to coexist independently within a larger cosmological framework.

At its core lies the Meterea, a primordial wellspring of neutral potential continuously generated by the collective unconscious of humanity. When a story, dream, or belief gathers sufficient focus and power, it draws from the Meterea to forge a new cosmos, complete with its own unique laws and internal coherence. This design enables vastly different settings—such as the Eldritch Realms, Ar’neth, and others—to thrive as distinct realities within the Ainerêve multiverse, preserving both narrative tension and player immersion.

This creative vision aligns with leadership’s strategic objectives for sustainable and scalable production. The studio operates through disciplined pipeline management, incorporating clear review cycles, scope management, and milestone accountability. Supported by pre-existing operational frameworks, this infrastructure fosters clarity, repeatability, and adaptability, enabling modular team roles, forecast-driven budgeting, and iterative refinement. These principles ensure the delivery of high-quality products that resonate with diverse audiences and across multiple media platforms.

While this document sets the high-level mission and strategic direction, critical operational details—such as the Adventure Framework and Scene Structure—are maintained in separate working documents. These provide practical tools for Game Masters and designers to translate the vision into cohesive narrative and mechanical experiences within each module.

*Footnote:* Certain internal tools and resources, developed prior to recent leadership changes, continue to guide narrative consistency and workflow integrity. These legacy assets remain central to maintaining the thematic core, though they are reserved for internal reference and not included in current public documentation.

### Staffing Model

Hoskbrew maintains a small core team on either full-time or hourly contracts, focusing on leadership and continuity roles such as Creative Infrastructure Lead and Project Manager. Other roles, including writers, editors, artists, and playtesters, are engaged on a contract basis per deliverable, allowing flexibility and efficient resource allocation aligned with production needs.

### 1\. The Pod-Based Operational Model

Hoskbrew’s operational model centers on modular, project-based roles rather than fixed departmental silos. This flexible approach allows the studio to assemble dynamic teams, or “pods,” tailored to each product’s specific scope and complexity. This structure is designed to foster focused collaboration, maximize resource efficiency, and maintain creative agility as projects and teams evolve.  
The studio balances a small, stable core of full-time or hourly contributors with a broader network of contract specialists engaged per project deliverable. This hybrid staffing model controls costs and aligns talent deployment directly with production demands.

## 2\. Leadership and Strategic Roles

To ensure both creative integrity and strategic growth, leadership functions within Hoskbrew are clearly delineated:

* Creative Infrastructure Lead: Serves as steward of canon, narrative consistency, worldbuilding integrity, and production pipeline management. Responsible for maintaining the world bible, managing lore retrieval systems (including AI-assisted tools¹), and ensuring continuity across all products. This role bridges creative vision and practical execution.  
* Marketing & Creative Strategy Lead: Focuses on external-facing strategies such as product positioning, brand development, audience engagement, and marketing outreach. Ensures strategic initiatives align with creative goals and resonate effectively with target audiences.

Separating these functions prevents operational overlap, reduces decision-making friction, and establishes clear accountability critical for scalable growth.

## 3\. Narrative Team Roles

To achieve creative depth while ensuring efficient production, the Lead Writer function is divided into two complementary roles. While these duties may blend within smaller teams, formally distinguishing them clarifies responsibilities and mitigates bottlenecks on larger projects:

* Primary Narrative Author: Develops core storylines, establishes setting lore, and crafts character arcs and thematic elements that drive the narrative experience.  
* Narrative Coordinator / Script Manager: Ensures narrative consistency across modules, manages contributions from other writers, maintains alignment with established canon and tone, coordinates revisions, and liaises closely with editorial and project management teams.

## 4\. Core Operational Roles & Responsibilities

Each project pod draws from the following operational roles, assigned dynamically based on project scope and requirements:

* Lead Writer(s): Craft detailed narrative content including setting descriptions, adventure scripts, and character development. Responsible for drafting and revising textual elements.  
* Developmental Editor: Collaborates with writers to refine structure, pacing, and clarity. Addresses inconsistencies and resolves scope-related issues.  
* Copy Editor: Ensures grammar, stylistic consistency, readability, and adherence to professional publication standards.  
* Layout Designer: Integrates text, artwork, and maps into cohesive, user-friendly documents ready for print and digital distribution.  
* Art Coordinator: Oversees the commissioning and selection of artwork and maps, ensuring visual consistency aligns with the project’s narrative tone and style.  
* Project Manager: Tracks timelines, manages milestones, facilitates internal communication, and ensures adherence to budget and scope forecasts.  
* QA & Playtest Coordinator: Organizes and runs playtesting sessions, compiles and synthesizes feedback, and provides actionable recommendations to inform product revisions.

## Technical Style Guide Summary (provided by Jon Creffield. Please see full document)

To maintain clarity, professionalism, and consistency across Hoskbrew’s published materials, the Hoskbrew Technical Style Guide provides detailed conventions for formatting, punctuation, and the presentation of game rules and textual elements. It complements the creative guidelines established in our narrative and editorial documentation.  
The Technical Style Guide defines best practices for:

* Headers and Typography: Clearly defined levels (H1 for chapters, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections, H4 for stat blocks), consistently applied in title case.  
* Text Emphasis: Guidelines for using bold (sparingly, primarily for stat blocks and key terms), italics (for read-aloud GM text, emphasis, spell names, item titles), and avoiding underlining, colored text, or excessive capitalization.  
* Lists and Tables: Standards for bullet and numbered lists to present clear, structured information. Guidelines for tagging intended tables and sidebars to be created during layout.  
* Stat Blocks: A structured format applicable across multiple rule systems, ensuring clarity and usability for quick reference.  
* Grammar and Punctuation: Clear standards on capitalization, comma usage (Oxford comma), quotations, apostrophes, and proper use of hyphens, en-dashes, em-dashes, ellipses, numbers, dice notations (e.g., 1d6), and distances (e.g., "10 ft.").

Regular reference to the Technical Style Guide by all contributors will reinforce Hoskbrew’s brand identity and ensure that readers consistently encounter clear, professional, and user-friendly content.  
*Note: Consult the full Technical Style Guide for comprehensive details and examples.*

¹ The Retrieval-Augmented Workflow (RAW) is a structured system for creating accurate, high-context documents using NotebookLM and a custom GPT. It begins with uploading authoritative sources—glossaries, style guides, or world notes—into both tools to establish a factual baseline. Raw inputs like transcripts or notes are then imported into NotebookLM, where targeted queries identify errors by comparing them to the canon. This contradiction analysis flags inconsistencies early, before any drafting occurs. A cleaned, corrected version is created from the raw material, forming a vetted source. This source is passed to the custom GPT, which transforms it into polished content without inventing new details. The GPT output is then run back through NotebookLM to verify accuracy against the original sources. If discrepancies are found, the vetted source is updated, and the cycle repeats. Once verified, the final output is saved, and temporary or flawed files are deleted to maintain clarity. RAW turns AI into a controlled, reliable tool for building lore, documentation, and structured content—grounded in fact and refined through human oversight.

## 4\. Budget Setting and Financial Oversight

Hoskbrew implements a role-based budgeting and forecasting framework designed to ensure financial planning is tightly coupled with actual production demands. This framework is built on empirical time-tracking, contingency planning, and modular project scopes to provide accurate, scalable budget options.

### Role-Based Hour Allocations and Contingency Planning

Each core and contract role is assigned expected hour ranges per project phase (writing, editing, layout, art coordination, project management) based on historical data and documented workflows. These estimates incorporate contingency buffers—typically 15–20%—to accommodate iterative revisions, scope shifts, and unforeseen delays, supporting realistic and adaptable budgeting.

### Tiered Scope Budgeting Options

Projects are classified into tiered scope levels—micro-modules, standard adventures, and full sourcebooks—each with predefined role involvement and forecasted hours. This tiered system enables leadership to select from multiple budget options aligned with strategic priorities and resource availability, ensuring flexibility without compromising creative quality.

### Distinction Between Salaried and Contract Labor

The budget model distinguishes between a small core of salaried or hourly creative infrastructure and project management staff—such as the Creative Infrastructure Lead and Project Manager—and a larger group of contract contributors engaged on a per-deliverable basis. This hybrid staffing approach balances financial sustainability with scalability.

### Collaborative Budget Management

Budget oversight is a shared responsibility among the CFO (or delegated financial authority), Project Manager, and Creative Infrastructure Lead. Together, they regularly review forecasting data, monitor expenses, and authorize purchases, ensuring transparency and alignment between financial resources and creative production.

### Notes for Matthew to Consider:

* Align budgeting discussions explicitly with the established tiered scope model and role-based hours, to avoid abstract or disconnected financial planning.  
* Recognize contingency as essential, not optional, to buffer against inevitable scope creep and iterative creative processes.  
* Differentiate clearly between core salaried staff and contract labor to maintain flexibility and control costs.  
* Ensure the CFO, PM, and Creative Infrastructure Lead collaborate closely, with defined responsibilities and communication rhythms to keep budgeting responsive and accurate.

## 5\. Creative Direction and Collaborative Control

Hoskbrew maintains clearly defined zones of creative authority to balance shared leadership and individual accountability. This ensures that creative vision, narrative consistency, and production decisions are made collaboratively but with clear ownership to prevent confusion and scope drift.  
Key practices include:

* Defined Authority Zones: Roles such as the Creative Infrastructure Lead hold stewardship over canon, tone, and pipeline integrity, while other leadership roles manage complementary strategic and operational functions. Clear boundaries help maintain focus and reduce overlapping responsibilities.  
* Scope Freeze Points: Establishing formal checkpoints within the production pipeline where scope and narrative content are locked. These freeze points prevent last-minute changes that can cause rework, production delays, and creative dilution.  
* Conflict Resolution Procedures: A structured process for resolving disputes over creative decisions or scope adjustments, involving designated leads and escalation paths to maintain momentum without sacrificing quality.  
* Team-Level Vision Ownership: Encouraging creative leads and contributors at the project and pod level to take ownership of their work, fostering accountability and investment in delivering coherent, high-quality narratives and mechanics.

Together, these practices ensure a healthy balance between creative freedom and disciplined execution, supporting the delivery of consistent and compelling products while minimizing inefficiencies and internal friction.

## 6\. Operational Recommendations and Next Steps

To transition from planning to effective execution, Hoskbrew should prioritize formalizing its operational structures and workflows, ensuring that established practices are clearly recognized and integrated into leadership decision-making.

* Formalize Role Recognition and Authority: Establish clear, documented role definitions and scopes of authority for key positions—including Creative Infrastructure Lead, Project Manager, Marketing Lead, and CFO. This will reduce ambiguity, empower accountability, and streamline decision-making.  
* Integrate Existing Documentation into Leadership Workflow: Incorporate foundational documents—such as the Process Guide, Prospectus Template, and Editorial Crosswalk—into the standard operational toolkit for leadership and teams. Regularly review and update these resources to maintain alignment between strategic goals and day-to-day production.  
* Improve Communication and Documentation Standards: Implement consistent communication protocols and documentation practices across projects. This includes standardized status reporting, version control, meeting cadence, and feedback loops to enhance transparency and reduce misunderstandings.  
* Enhance Marketing Role Support and CFO Coverage: Address current gaps by recruiting or contracting experienced marketing professionals or agencies to develop and execute brand and outreach strategies. Similarly, define or fill the CFO role to oversee financial planning, budget adherence, and procurement processes, supporting sustainable growth.
