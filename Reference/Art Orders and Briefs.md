# Art Orders and Briefs

## Purpose

This document defines the **four-field system** for generating art orders and briefs for the Hoskbrew studio. The goal is to create painter-focused, visually-grounded directives that avoid narrative drift and maintain visual primacy.

---

## The Four-Field System

Every art order must be assembled using these four fields:

### 1. **Location**
The physical setting or environment where the scene takes place.

- **What it is**: Geographic, architectural, or spatial context
- **Examples**: "A moss-covered stone bridge", "Inside a candlelit tavern", "A fog-shrouded forest clearing"
- **Rules**:
  - Must be visually observable
  - No abstract concepts or emotional states
  - Focus on paintable elements: structures, terrain, weather

### 2. **Focus**
The primary subject or center of visual attention.

- **What it is**: The main character, creature, object, or element that anchors the composition
- **Examples**: "An armored knight", "A hooded merchant", "A stone altar with glowing runes"
- **Rules**:
  - Must be a concrete, visible subject
  - Can include pose or basic physical description
  - Avoid backstory or motivation

### 3. **Action**
What is happening in the scene - the dynamic element.

- **What it is**: Physical movement, gesture, or activity being performed
- **Examples**: "Drawing a sword", "Reading from a scroll", "Fleeing in panic"
- **Rules**:
  - Must be a visible, paintable action
  - No internal thoughts or emotions (unless they have visible manifestations)
  - Focus on body language and physical activity

### 4. **Mood**
The visual atmosphere created through lighting, color, and artistic treatment.

- **What it is**: The aesthetic and tonal qualities that define how the image feels
- **Sub-fields**:
  - **Lighting**: Light source, time of day, quality (harsh/soft/dramatic)
  - **Contrast**: High/low, sharp/subtle
  - **Palette**: Color scheme (warm/cool, saturated/muted)
  - **Atmosphere**: Environmental effects (fog, dust, rain, magical glow)
  - **Presence** (optional): Scale, composition notes

- **Examples**: 
  - "Moonlight filtering through trees, cool blue palette, high contrast shadows"
  - "Golden hour warmth, soft diffused light, low contrast, peaceful"
  - "Torchlight and deep shadows, orange and black, dramatic high contrast"

## Rules and Constraints

### Visual Primacy
- **DO**: Describe only what can be painted or drawn
- **DON'T**: Include thoughts, feelings, backstory, or narrative context
- **DON'T**: Use abstract concepts that aren't visually observable

### Grammar Check
Before approving any art order, verify:
1. ✅ Location is a concrete physical space
2. ✅ Focus is a visible subject or object
3. ✅ Action is a paintable physical activity
4. ✅ Mood describes visual/aesthetic qualities only
5. ❌ No mention of emotions unless they're visible in expression/posture
6. ❌ No backstory or narrative context
7. ❌ No abstract or non-visual concepts

### Bad Examples (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Bad Location**: "A place where heroes are made"
✅ **Good Location**: "A training yard with wooden practice dummies"

❌ **Bad Focus**: "A brave warrior struggling with inner demons"
✅ **Good Focus**: "A scar-faced warrior in battered armor"

❌ **Bad Action**: "Contemplating the meaning of sacrifice"
✅ **Good Action**: "Kneeling before a memorial stone, head bowed"

❌ **Bad Mood**: "Feeling hopeless and abandoned"
✅ **Good Mood**: "Cold blue light, high contrast shadows, desaturated palette, oppressive atmosphere"
