## **Metric Definitions**

### **Hourly Rate** (`$20/hr`)
The cost per hour for this team member. Used to calculate weekly and monthly burn rates.

### **Hours/Week** (`20 hrs/wk`)
The expected weekly time commitment for this role. Multiply by hourly rate for weekly cost.

### **Output Rate** (`200 w/hr`)
The expected productivity metric (typically words/hour for narrative roles). Helps estimate delivery timelines and identify bottlenecks.

### **Buffer %** (`15% buffer`)
A contingency buffer applied to time estimates to account for revisions, feedback cycles, and unexpected scope adjustments. Industry standard: 10–20%.

---

## **Budget & Contingency Planning**

### **Weekly Burn Rate Calculation**
```
Hourly Rate × Hours/Week = Weekly Cost
```

### **Monthly Burn Rate**
```
Weekly Cost × 4.3 (average weeks/month) = Monthly Cost
```

### **Project Timeline with Buffer**
```
Target Output ÷ Output Rate = Base Hours Needed
Base Hours × (1 + Buffer %) = Padded Hours with Contingency
```

### **Example:**
- Lead Writer at $25/hr, 20 hrs/wk, 200 w/hr output, 15% buffer
- **Weekly Cost:** $500
- **Monthly Cost:** $2,150
- **Capacity:** 4,000 words/week (200 w/hr × 20 hrs)
- **With 15% Buffer:** 3,480 reliable words/week (accounting for revisions)

---

## **Role Assignment Guidelines**

### **Small Project (Scope: <50k words)**
- 1 Lead Writer (part-time, 15–20 hrs/wk)
- 1 Developmental Editor (part-time, 8–10 hrs/wk)
- 1 Copy Editor (as-needed)
- 1 Project Manager (part-time, 5–10 hrs/wk)

### **Medium Project (Scope: 50k–150k words)**
- 1–2 Lead Writers (20–25 hrs/wk each)
- 1 Narrative Coordinator (15–20 hrs/wk)
- 1 Developmental Editor (10–15 hrs/wk)
- 1 Copy Editor (part-time, 8–10 hrs/wk)
- 1 Layout Designer (part-time, 10–15 hrs/wk)
- 1 Project Manager (10–15 hrs/wk)

---

## **Contingency & Risk Management**

### **Scope Buffers**
- **Standard Buffer:** 10–15% added to all time estimates
- **High-Risk Roles:** Writers (subject-matter expertise delays) may warrant 20% buffer
- **Editorial Roles:** 15% buffer standard (revisions cycles unpredictable)

### **Capacity Reserves**
- **Recommended:** Hold 10–20% of team capacity in reserve for unexpected feedback cycles
- **Example:** If a writer has capacity for 4,000 words/wk, plan projects at 3,200–3,600 words/wk

### **Escalation Protocol**
- If a role approaches >80% capacity, flag for backlog review
- Engage contract specialists early to avoid bottlenecks
- Re-baseline forecasts every 2 weeks

---

## **Key Principles**

1. **Clarity:** Every team member knows their role, output expectations, and contingency buffers
2. **Flexibility:** Use contract specialists for surge capacity; maintain lean core team for stability
3. **Accountability:** Track actual hours, output, and costs against forecasts
4. **Visibility:** Update team composition and forecasts when scope or team changes
5. **Iteration:** Refine rates and output expectations quarterly based on actual performance data
